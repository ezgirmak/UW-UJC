## How to Read a Scientific Article

Carey, M. A., Steiner, K. L., & Petri Jr, W. A. (2020). Ten simple rules for reading a scientific paper. *PLoS computational biology*, *16*(7), e1008032. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008032](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008032)

## Rule 1: Pick your reading goal

![](./uw-ujc-oct04_images/pcbi.1008032.t001.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Rule 2: Understand the author's goal

- What is the author's goal for sharing this project?
  - Who are the author(s)? What lab are they from?
  - How are they interpreting the data?
- What kind of article is it?
  - Common journal article focuses: research article, methods, resources, software
  - Review-like: review (actively looking forward, retrospective), commentary

## Rules 3: Ask six questions

1. What do the author(s) want to know (motivation)?
2. What did they do (approach / methods)?
3. Why was it done that way (context within the field)?
4. What do the results show (figures and data table)?
    - Or what do the results *not* show. 
5. How did the author(s) interpret the results (interpretation/discussion)?
6. What should be done next?

## Rule 4: Unpack each figure and table

- Each figure (or figure panel) should have a "take home" message.
- If you can explain a paper by its figures alone, you've got the skeleton of a journal club presentation.

Skipping Rule 5 about paper formating as they radically differ.

## Rule 6: Be critical

:::{.callout-important}
"Published papers are not truths etchned in stone."
:::

- Published papers are not textbooks (and even then!). 
- Always be critical of the results presented.
- Be aware of how norrow or broadly the paper's claims are.

## That being said...

- Rule 7: Be kind
  - Everyone is human and humans make mistake. 
  - Do not say anything that you would not say to the author(s) if they were in-person.
  - English may be the official language of science, but it is not everyone's native language!
  
- Rule 8: Be ready to go the extra mile
  - Author(s) cannot write a textbook each time they write a paper, you will have to do some leg work at some point in order to fully understand everything.

## Rules 9-10: Talk about it & Build on it

- What we are doing now!
- Journal clubs, one-on-one/group meetings, over coffee, etc. 

## How to Write a Scientific Article

Carandini, M. (2022). Some Tips for Writing Science. *eNeuro*, *9*(6).  [https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0497-22.2022](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0497-22.2022)


## General tips

:::fragment

:::{.callout-note}
"Scientific ideas can be understood only if they are simple, and the job of making them simple is the writer’s, not the reader’s"
:::

:::

- Write simply, identify key questions, write in paragraphs, use topic sentences, structure the sentences with information in the right places, and make informative figures.

## Abstract 

- A general rule is that the abstract should consists of 1-2 sentences from each section of the paper (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion). 
- Most people only ever read the abstract, so it should to be a concise summary of the *entire* paper. 

## Introduction

- The first paragraph should set up the broad area of inquiry an ideally open with a vivid sentence. (If that cannot be achieved, be straightforward). 
- The introduction pose the questions that the paper answers.
- Last paragraph usually dscribes the main results.

:::fragment

:::{.callout-tip}
"When presenting the questions, beware of asserting that they are “interesting,” “important,” or “understudied.” Let the reader conclude that they are interesting or important. As for “understudied,” it makes a weak case: they maybe understudied because unimportant."
:::

## Methods

- Write the Methods section such that readers can go directly from Introduction to Results (unless it is a methods paper). 
- Write the methods section such that a naive reader can **replicate** the entire experiment. 
- Provide detailed software intructions, GitHub repositories, and/or access to data whenever possible!

## Results

- Write the Results section with subsections based on figures, which illustrate the main point of an analysis.
- The text should walk the reader through the figure. It may be obvious to you, but it will not be to someone else.
- **Report** the results, interpretation of what the numbers mean comes in the discussion.
- The ordering of the results section should generally go from broad to specific. 
  - E.g., Summary statistics to analysis of group differences. 

## Discussion

- The first paragraph usually summarizes the main findings, focused on the questions the paper set out to address.
- The key job of the Discussion is to draw conclusions, which are different from summaries.
- Finally, the Discussion is an opportunity to indicate the limitations of the paper.
- A final conclusion paragraph is useful for readers who want to extract a summary of the strongest claims the paper makes.
